I've been learning a little about web development frameworks and one I liked was [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). I started working on a personal project called [gd-ae-](https://github.com/henriquefacioli/gd-ae-) that is a system for students evaluating unicamp classes and teachers in a discreet way -  want to make a post about it any time soon - but recently all i did was helping our academic center(?) on it's [website](http://caco.ic.unicamp.br) that was written in django too and we've been talking about CACo's server an so, and we decided using Docker on it. So, there I go :)

***THIS IS MY FIRST ATTEMPT WITH DOCKER, so any tips and corrections are welcome***

[To be continue]...
