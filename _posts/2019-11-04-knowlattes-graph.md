As a final project in my college, me and my friend Thiagao, wanted to try to learn something while keeping things easy and for that we aimed in
finding an interest topic for both of us: Knowledge representation; 
With tha in mind we focused on building and publishing a knowledge graph containing scietific publications from brasil most famous website - [Lattes](https://www.lattes.cnpq.br/)

This is the end of the project - maybe someone could find it usefull:

### Update 2023
The demo was hosted on heroku on their free tier; As it was only a fun project we haven't kept it; Tho, you can reproduce it using the repos;
