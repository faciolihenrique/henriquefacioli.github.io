since 2009 i've been using mac and had forgotten how nice it is to have headaches with compuuter configuration. using mac is very nice. but folks, how i missed this!   

i bough a dell vostro 5480 and decided to install arch on it. follow the wiki and everything worked. not the way i wanted, but working. so, i'm on my way to get things work properly as i want. and things i did and worked i'm going to write in here.

## Problem on the Mousepad
since i used a mac for about 5 years, when i touched my mousepad, it felt like a lack of sensibility. the size was great, but sensitivity. :/
