<p>
	welcome to my personal website! Here I pretend to post some information about myself, my computer discoveries, development and anything i want. I own this page, so I do whatever I want. maybe. not. definitely not. Ok
</p>
<p>
	maybe, just maybe, you may be courious about the name. WHAT THE HELL UNICORN? I don't know either. I was just veryyyy happy that i found a very beautiful favicon icon of an unicorn.
</p>
<p>
	maybe it stays this empty forever, just beacause it's mine. That's what I want or maybe i'm just to shy to post.
